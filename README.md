# C- Language Compiler by Ian Fleming

Here you will find the codebase for my language compiler made from scratch. The custom language this compiler was made for is called "C-". 
You can find the grammar and other information on the syntax and behavior of this language in the C- Grammar PDF in the 'final' branch.
This repository contains various implementations of programming concepts, principles, and techniques related to compiler design and development. 
This was assigned as a class project for my CS445 Compiler course at the University of Idaho in Spring 2023.

## Installation

This project requires you to have ``a native gcc/g++ compiler, make, bison, and flex`` installed and working properly in your native environment.

1. Clone the repostiory

    ``git clone https://github.com/ibfleming/my-compiler.git``

## Usage

1. Compile the program.

    ``make clean;make``

    *This first cleans the old objects/artifacts from previous compilations and then compiles.*

3. Executing the program...
